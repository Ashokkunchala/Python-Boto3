# Day 37 — Retries and Timeouts

## Goal
Use botocore Config for bounded retries and network timeouts.

## Example
```python
Config(retries={"mode":"adaptive", "max_attempts":8}, connect_timeout=5, read_timeout=60)
```

## Exercises
1. Read the official Boto3 API shape for today's service/topic.
2. Write a read-only script.
3. Add clear error handling.

## Mini challenge
Create a read-only AWS report for today's topic. Do not delete or modify resources.

## Safety rule
Start with read-only operations. Never place access keys in source code. Use the AWS credential chain/profile configuration.

## DevOps connection
This is where Python fundamentals become AWS automation.

## Checklist
- [ ] I understand the concept.
- [ ] I can explain the API call.
- [ ] I tested read-only behavior.
- [ ] I handled likely errors.
